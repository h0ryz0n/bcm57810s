playing with my network board, firmwares and drivers  
  
hardware is a a 10GtekÂ® 10Gb PCI-E NIC Dual SFP+ Port board, chipset is a Broadcom BCM57810S

server is a pure kvm/qemu debian hypervisor and board ports are configured in passthrough to a opnsense guest

I'll keep here all my outputs and all the infos
